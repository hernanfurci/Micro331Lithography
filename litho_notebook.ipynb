Later on, we view a glass wafer on which a metal pattern is created using lift-off, utilizing the previously displayed mask. The operator employs a mask aligner to align the pattern on the mask with the wafer before exposing it to light through the mask (akin to a stencil). Finally, after the metal deposition by evaporation (which is not depicted in the video), the wafer is immersed in a solvent to remove the remaining resist and the metal on top of it.
